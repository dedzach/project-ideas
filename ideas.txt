Pitch Idea: RepIt is an application that allows users to input their current workout routine for days, weeks, reps, sets, and workout type. Once these pieces of information are added,

MVP: 
    1. Users can log into the app
    2. Users can input the name of the exercise they're performing
    3. Users can input the amount of reps and/or time.
    4. Users can choose how the app will automatically increment reps, weight, or time to their next workout
    5. Button to complete workout and a category for each workout type.
    6. Users can tap an exercise to cross it off the list. 

Future Features: 
    1. Users can input how hard or difficult the workout was and the app will automatically adjust 
    2. Users will be able to connect to social media to connect with friends and family
